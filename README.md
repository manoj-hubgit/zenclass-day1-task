Task 1: HTTP/1 vs. HTTP/2

HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 are web protocols with key differences:
  HTTP/2 multiplexes requests over a single connection, reducing latency.
  HTTP/2 compresses headers, improving efficiency.
  HTTP/2 supports server push and request prioritization for faster page loads.

Task 2: JavaScript Objects

JavaScript objects are simple data structures:
  They store information in key-value pairs.
  They can inherit properties from other objects.
  Engines optimize them internally for better performance.
